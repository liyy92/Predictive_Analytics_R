# Predictive_Analytics_R
This course introduces the student to some of the most commonly used techniques used for making data-driven predictions. Each technique is introduced in the context of a business problem from which the student identifies and describes the features that theinput historical data must have in order to make appropriate use of such a technique. Variations of the motivating problem are used as a way to simulate feedback from different stakeholders as well as way to motivate model refinements. These simulations are also used as a means for the students to communicate the outcomes of a predictive analysis model (and of the decisions made during modeling) to interested parties.
